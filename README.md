## Background

A friend works at a warehouse and was tasked to optimize routes for traversing the aisles via Excel and manually creating upwards of single column 70,000 row csv files by manipulating then copying and pasting pre formatted columns. This task averaged 1-2 weeks per floor. I wanted to help speed that up and help reduce errors.
